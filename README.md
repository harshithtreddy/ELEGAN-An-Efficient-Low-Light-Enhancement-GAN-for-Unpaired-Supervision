# ELEGAN-An-Efficient-Low-Light-Enhancement-GAN-for-Unpaired-Supervision
Developed an innovative, lightweight unsupervised model aimed at enhancing low-light images. This model employs cutting-edge attention-guided generative adversarial networks (GANs), featuring three distinct encoding levels to optimize low-light image enhancement followed by two discriminators.
